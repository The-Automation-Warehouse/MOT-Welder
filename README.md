In this project, I tried to make a spot welder from a motor and a microwave oven transformer (MOT). But I ended up with more of a metal melter.


## DISCLAIMER
This project involves working with mains voltage electricity and very high current and can be dangerous. I am not responsible for any damage or injury caused by following this guide.
Open a microwave oven has killed people before, so proceed at your own risk.
I will not show how to extract and modify the MOT, as there are better and safer guide on the internet.
